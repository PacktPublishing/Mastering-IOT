# Mastering IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the fastest growing technology market. Industries are
embracing IoT technologies to improve operational expenses, product life, and
people's well-being.
You’ll begin your journey with an introduction to Raspberry Pi and quickly jump
right into Python programming. You’ll learn all concepts through multiple projects,
and then reinforce your learnings by creating an IoT robot car. You’ll examine
modern sensor systems and focus on what their power and functionality can bring to
your system. You’ll also gain insight into cloud and fog architectures, including the
OpenFog standards. The Learning Path will conclude by discussing three forms of
prevalent attacks and ways to improve the security of your IoT infrastructure.
By the end of this Learning Path, you would’ve traversed the entire spectrum of
technologies needed to build a successful IoT system, and would have the confidence
to build, secure, and monitor your IoT infrastructure.
This Learning Path includes content from the following Packt products:
* Internet of Things Programming Projects by Colin Dow
* Internet of Things for Architects by Perry Lea



## What you will learn
* Build a home security dashboard using an infrared motion detector
* Receive data and display it with an actuator connected to the Raspberry Pi
* Build an IoT robot car that is controlled via the Internet
* Use IP-based communication to easily and quickly scale your system
* Explore cloud protocols, such as Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and CoAP
* Secure communication with encryption forms, such as symmetric key

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* Memory: 4 GB RAM
* Storage: 10 GB available space
* Raspberry Pi Computer
* Basic electronic components



### Software requirements
You’ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* OS: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit
* Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
